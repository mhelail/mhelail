# Hi, I'm Mohamed 👋

I'm a Computer Engineering student interested in **Cybersecurity**, **Web Application Security** and **Deep Learning**.

### What I’ve been working on

-  **Smart Deepfake Detection System** – Python, CNN, TensorFlow  
  TÜBİTAK–Supported Deepfake Detection Graduation Project focused on detecting manipulated facial videos using deep learning and image processing.

-  **OWASP Top 10 Educational Web Security Site** – HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP  
  Small training website that demonstrates common web vulnerabilities and basic secure coding ideas.
  Repo: [SnowNoVA](https://github.com/mhelail/SnowNoVA)

- **Malware Sandbox Simulator (Educational)** – C#, .NET, WinForms  
  Windows desktop app that simulates how common malware families behave on an endpoint (ransomware, infostealers, keyloggers, fileless attacks, wipers) in a safe, in-memory way, with behaviour mapped to MITRE ATT&CK techniques for learning and practice.  
  Repo: [MalwareSandboxSimulator](https://github.com/mhelail/MalwareSandboxSimulator)

- **HexTriage (AI-Powered Malware Triage)** – Python, YARA, PE Analysis, LightGBM (EMBER2024)
  
  Static-only malware triage for PE files: extracts PE metadata/features, runs YARA + weighted heuristics, and adds ML risk scoring. Generates clean JSON/HTML reports with clear evidence and dual-use (LOLBin) awareness.
  Repo: [HexTriage](https://github.com/mhelail/HexTriage)

-  **Real-Time Communication Platform** – Node.js, Socket.IO, WebRTC, MongoDB  
  Real-time chat and simple voice calls with JWT-based authentication.  
  Repo: [real-time-communication-platform](https://github.com/mhelail/real-time-communication-platform)

-  **Employee Attendance & Activity System** – C#, WinForms, MySQL  
  Desktop app to manage employees, attendance status (Present / Absent / Late) and simple activity notes.  
  Repo: [EmployeeAttendanceSystem](https://github.com/mhelail/EmployeeAttendanceSystem)
